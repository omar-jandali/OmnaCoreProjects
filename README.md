This repository is where all of the OmnaCore project code will be uploaded and contantly updated to the latest version during development and testing.

The first of the main project that will be public is TASTEBUDS

Tastebuds is an online web application/service that will be a dish and restaurant review app, but unlike all of the other similar services out there, this one will be focus around the food and dishes that customers order.

The philosophy behind is is simple:
A restaurant is a place where people go eat food and should be rated on the food that they provide, with our focus on the food you are eating, others will be able to make decision based on that very thing they wish to get.

Instructions to downloading and setting up vagrant will be coming soon so check up in the next couple days for that information.
